## About

TeraSim is an **open-source traffic simulation platform** designed for **naturalistic and adversarial testing** of autonomous vehicles (AVs). It enables **high-speed, AI-driven testing environment generation** to expose AVs to both routine and **rare, high-risk driving conditions**.  

Developed with **researchers, AV developers, and regulators** in mind, TeraSim is designed to better support **ISO 21448 (SOTIF) and ISO 34502 compliance**, providing a **scalable, automated, and unbiased AV evaluation framework**.

Built upon the open-source traffic simulation software [SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/), TeraSim extends its capabilities to provide specialized features for autonomous vehicle testing.

## 🚀 Upcoming Features

### **🌎 TeraSim-World — Coming Soon**

The source code for **TeraSim-World** will soon be released **within this repository** as a next-generation extension of TeraSim.   

It automatically synthesizes geographically grounded, safety-critical data for E2E autonomous driving at anythere in the world.

See our [📄 arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13164) and [🌐 videos](https://wjiawei.com/terasim-world-web/) for details.
