<strong>Generative AI–Driven Autonomous Vehicle Simulation for Unknown Unsafe Events Discovery</strong>
</p>

---

## Overview

TeraSim is an open-source platform for automated autonomous-vehicle (AV) simulation using generative AI.
Its primary objective is to **efficiently uncover real-world unknown unsafe events** by automatically creating diverse and statistically realistic traffic environments.

The framework has evolved from its initial focus on planning-and-control testing to a **complete simulation workflow**, which now includes:

1. **High-fidelity HD map generation** for large-scale, accurate simulation environments
2. **Generative traffic environment creation** for naturalistic and adversarial scenario testing
3. **Generative sensor simulation** for camera and LiDAR perception validation

This expanded scope enables a unified pipeline from map generation to perception and planning validation.

## 🚀 **Updates**

## Key Capabilities

### 1. High-Fidelity HD Map Generation

* Tools for building **city-scale, high-resolution digital twins** suitable for AV testing.
* Automated conversion of real-world survey data into simulation-ready HD maps.
* Provides accurate lane geometry and traffic-control metadata for downstream simulations.

### 2. Generative Traffic Environment Creation

* Automated scenario generation based on **large-scale naturalistic driving data**.
* **Adversarial scenario synthesis** to reveal rare or high-risk interactions (e.g., aggressive cut-ins, unexpected pedestrian crossings).
* Integration with [SUMO](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/) and third-party simulators such as [CARLA](https://carla.org/) and Autoware.

### 3. Generative Sensor Simulation

* **`terasim-cosmos`** integrates TeraSim-World with **generative AI–based camera and LiDAR simulation**.
* Enables perception validation and sensor pipeline testing under diverse conditions.
* **Ongoing work:** support for fully **custom sensor models and configurable realism levels** is under active development.

## Installation

### Quick Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcity/TeraSim.git
cd TeraSim
conda create -n terasim python=3.10 -y
conda activate terasim
./setup_environment.sh
```

This script installs all required Python packages and dependencies, including [SUMO](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/).

<!-- ### Docker Installation (Recommended for Production)

For a containerized environment with all dependencies pre-installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcity/TeraSim.git
cd TeraSim
docker-compose up -d --build
docker-compose exec terasim bash
```

See [README_DOCKER.md](README_DOCKER.md) for detailed Docker deployment instructions. -->

**Requirements**

* Python 3.10–3.12
* SUMO 1.23.1 (installed by the setup script)
* Redis for service components
* gcc/g++ compilers (for Cython extensions)
