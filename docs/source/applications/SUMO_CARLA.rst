SUMO-Carla Co-simulation
===========================
At the current stage, the main objective of SUMO-CARLA co-simulation is to render the traffic flows in 3D environment. This application implements SUMO Traci server, Carla simulator and Carla synchronization module. With these tools, the date transfer from our simulation platform to Carla simulator is realized.
